# NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ReportVersions::Tiny - reports dependency versions during testing

# VERSION

version 1.05

# SYNOPSIS

In your `dist.ini`, include `[ReportVersions::Tiny]` to load the plugin.

# DESCRIPTION

This module integrates with [Dist::Zilla](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Dist::Zilla) to automatically add an additional
test to your released software.  Rather than testing features of the software,
this reports the versions of all static module dependencies, and of Perl, at
the time the tests are run.

The value of this is that when someone submits a test failure report you can
see which versions of the modules were installed and, hopefully, be able to
reproduce problems that are dependent on a specific set of module versions.

# Differences from Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ReportVersions

This module has the same goal as [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ReportVersions](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ReportVersions), but
takes a much lighter weight approach: the module that inspired my code bundles
a copy of YAML::Tiny, reads META.yml, then reports from that.

This gives the most accurate picture, since any requirements added at install
time will be detected, but is overkill for the vast majority of modules that
use a simple, static list of dependencies.

This module, rather, generates the list of modules to test at the time the
distribution is being built, and reports from that static list.

The biggest advantage of this is that I no longer have to bundle a large
volume of code that isn't really needed, and have a simpler test suite with
less places that things can go wrong.

# ARGUMENTS

- __exclude__

Exclude an individual items from version reporting.

This is most commonly required if some module otherwise interferes with the
normal operation of the tests, such as [Module::Install](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Install), which does not
behave as you might expect if normally `use`d.

- __include__

    [ReportVersions::Tiny]
    include = JSON:PP 2.27103
    include = Path::Class
    include = Some::Thing = 1.1

Include extra modules in version reporting.
This can be specified multiple times.  The module name and version can be
separated by spaces (and/or an equal sign).  If no version is specified
"0" will be used.

This can be useful to help track down issues in installation or testing
environments.  Perhaps a module used by one of your prereqs is broken
and/or has a missing (or insufficient) dependency.  You can use this option
to specify multiple extra modules whose versions you would like reported.
They aren't modules that you need to declare as prerequisites
since you don't use them directly, but you've found installation issues
and it would be nice to show which version (if any) is in fact installed.

This option is inspired by advice from Andreas J. KÃ¶nig (ANDK)
who suggested adding a list of "interesting modules" to the
`Makefile.PL` and checking their version so that the test reports can show
which version (if any) is in fact installed
(see the [CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPAN) dist for an example).
